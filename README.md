# RIS-GAN_self_implement
This is RIS-GAN code implemented by myself based on https://github.com/zhling2020/RIS-GAN

Tensorflow 2.XX is required to run the code.
Some hyperparameters in G_LOSS are modulated to get a refined result. Some results are in result directory.
The Network architecture in this code is the same in the paper.
