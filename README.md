# RIS-GAN_self_implement
This is RIS-GAN code implemented by myself based on https://github.com/zhling2020/RIS-GAN

Tensorflow 2.XX is required to run the code.

Some hyperparameters in G_LOSS are modulated to get more refined resultS, which are in result directory.

The Network architecture in this code is more similar to that in the paper than the reference code.

Solved the Explosing Gradient problem of G_LOSS in the reference code.
